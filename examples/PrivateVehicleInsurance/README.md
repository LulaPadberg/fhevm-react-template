# Private Vehicle Insurance Platform

A revolutionary decentralized insurance platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality in vehicle insurance processing and claims management.

## 🌟 Overview

This platform represents a breakthrough in insurance technology, combining blockchain transparency with cryptographic privacy. Using Zama's FHE technology, all sensitive information including personal data, claim amounts, and financial details remain encrypted throughout the entire insurance lifecycle while still enabling computational operations.

## 🔐 Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Insurance
- **Complete Privacy**: All personal information, vehicle values, and claim amounts are encrypted and never exposed
- **Computational Privacy**: Mathematical operations on encrypted data without decryption
- **Zero Knowledge Processing**: Insurance calculations performed without revealing underlying data
- **End-to-End Confidentiality**: From policy creation to claim settlement, data remains private

### Confidential Vehicle Insurance Processing
- **Private Policy Management**: Age, driving experience, and vehicle details encrypted on-chain
- **Secure Claims Processing**: Damage assessments and repair costs processed confidentially
- **Encrypted Risk Assessment**: AI-powered risk scoring without exposing personal information
- **Confidential Settlements**: Payout calculations performed on encrypted data

## 🚗 Key Features
